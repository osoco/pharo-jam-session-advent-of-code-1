Class:
I represent any attendee of this Jam session.

Responsibility:
I'm able to:
- Display a photo of myself in the image (just send me a showYourself message).
- Hide my photo in the image (tell me to hideYourself).
- Answer what I'm currently working on.
Anyone asking for help can reach me via can_you_help_me: message.
Conversely, if I request help from others, they can notify me when they're done by sending me a mission_accomplished message.

Collaborators:
- I talk with any other attendees to solve the specific puzzle we are working in.
- I usually just send can_you_help_me:,mission_accomplished, or what_are_you_working_on messages to other attendees.
