Class:
I'm a test. Specifically, I consider myself as a meta test. I only give a hint of how to start the challenge, which means writing the first test.

Responsibility:
I define the first test to implement in order to start the challenge.

Collaborators:
I'm part of the message to be sent to the first attendee to start solving the challenge using TDD.
